    As we’ve learned throughout the course of this semester, UI and UX are extremely important and is the fundamental aspect of a website. If you want your website to function well, look good as well as serve the purpose it’s meant to serve, you need to ensure that the UI and UX of the website is good. UI is directly linked to UX. If the user interface isn’t good, the user experience won’t be good. “A well-designed UI/UX can improve user engagement, increase site traffic, and enhance user satisfaction. It helps users to navigate the site easily, find relevant information, and perform desired actions.” (sgstechnologies, n.d.).

  The website I chose to talk about is the ‘BusinessTech’ website (BusinessTech, 2019). This website is a South African news website that covers a range of topics related to business, technology, and finance. The website features articles, news stories, and opinion pieces on topics such as entrepreneurship, innovation, markets, investments, and more. As we were meant to find a South African website, I searched for, ‘South African websites’ on Google and not many came up. Some of the big and well-known websites with millions of users were the few that did show. This proved to me how important SEO is, as there are millions of South African websites, but when searching for ‘South African Websites’ only a few showed up on Google. 
Through the process of learning about web design and through the process of actually making a website, you start to naturally notice what’s good and what’s bad. Things I normally wouldn’t take note of, I now start to notice. The framework I use to identify good UI/UX design is “The Basic Principles of User Interface Design” (Studio by UXPin, 2020). 


 </p>
 <p>
  The first thing I noticed when opening up the website was the simple and clean aesthetic. It uses simple colours and simple text which stand out and which is easy to view. This ties in with one of the basic principles of user design, aiming for simplicity (Studio by UXPin, 2020).
The nav bar is situated at the top of the page and it has links to all the different genres of articles that the website has. It also has a hover feature which highlights the things which you hover over. This is a common practice with nav bars and makes the choices of the user more obvious and easy to understand. The search bar is also located on the top right of the page, which is a conventional and common practice that also ties into it being a simple design. In terms of providing useful feedback, wherever I am on the website, I am well aware of it and I understand what is going on. I also know how to navigate to where I came from and where I want to go to. The website is able to reduce the cognitive load, as mentioned in “The Basic Principles of User Interface Design” (Studio by UXPin, 2020) by breaking down all actions and information into chunks. There is a list view of different articles which shows an image and a heading for the article. This is extremely helpful in showing me an overview of what the article is about before even going into the article and it also breaks down the information. Instead of showing me half a page of information for each article before clicking it, it just shows a brief overview of information. When clicking on a specific article, the entire article is displayed and nothing else distracts me from viewing the article. It also follows the 3-click rule (Studio by UXPin, 2020) as it does not take more than 3 clicks to access any information. 

 </p>

 <p>
  As I’ve mentioned previously, the website uses basic and simple colours and text, with white being the primary background colour and black being the primary text colour. This makes the website accessible, even for those that may be visually impaired (Studio by UXPin, 2020). 
I’ve used the website on a laptop, phone as well as an Ipad and the website was optimized for all 3. This forms part of the flexibility of the website (Studio by UXPin, 2020). Overall in terms of the UI, the layout is easy to navigate, with clear headings and sections for different types of news articles. All information is easily accessible and the website makes good use of most of the basic design principles for user interface (Studio by UXPin, 2020).

  “UX exists in the mind of the user, not in the object (or artifact). Thus, UX is not identified as the object itself; instead, it is the user’s experience that occur as a result of interactions with the object” (Goldberg, 2021). The user experience is different for everyone, as mentioned in the quote above, UX exists in the mind of the user. Whilst it is different for everyone, based on my experience and interaction with the website, I can say that, due to the user-interface being designed well, this allowed the user-experience to also work well. The website appears to be optimized for speed and performance as there was no lagging or slow response times. Everything loaded extremely quickly. The audience for this website is South Africans as almost all the articles showcased are related to South Africans. Residents of South Africa are a very broad audience, and different people are interested in different things, however, the website manages to focus on a few different audiences amongst South Africans. It does this by making use of navigational tools. Right at the top of the page is a nav bar which has different broad topics which different people might be interested in. For example, I’m not a big fan of politics and I don’t enjoy spending my time consuming information on politics, but I do enjoy tech and everything related to tech. I can click on the ‘Technology’ link in the nav bar and all tech related articles will be shown to me. Pam Berg states that you should be judicious with menu choices, as too many options can cause a visitor to pick nothing (Berg, 2021). She also states that a good menu should have a clear selection of options, neatly categorized into logical groups, and this is what the ‘BusinessTech’ website does. Ensuring clear wording on menus and buttons is also something that Pam mentions as a good UX practice (Berg, 2021). ‘BusinessTech’ follows this practice as all menus and buttons have clear and simple wording such as, submit, login, follow us, about us.

  “Ethical design basically means making conscious design decisions that do good and do not harm anyone—either intentionally or unintentionally” (Ganchi, 2021). Ethical design is an important topic, especially with things that will be posted to the public and accessed by the public. In the context of a news website, ethical design includes accessibility, accuracy, transparency, privacy as well as influence. With accessibility, a news website should be accessible to all users, irrespective of their conditions. I mentioned previously how this website is accessible to people with visual impairments as well. With accuracy, a news website needs to provide accurate and unbiased information. Unfortunately in this instance, it isn’t 100% clear as to how accurate the news posts are, but with 30 million page views, it definitely leads to the fact that people enjoy what they read and it is therefore accurate. In terms of transparency, websites should be transparent about its funding sources, and affiliations. This is something that ’BusinessTech’ isn’t transparent about as its funding sources, apart from the cost of advertising and running ads isn’t disclosed to the public. 
Privacy is also a very important aspect about ethical design practices. ‘BusinessTech’ does not ask for any personal information and there is no information disclosed by the users. You can view the articles for free without disclosing any personal information. From my experience with the website, I did not notice any ill or misdirected intent, specifically with dark patterns on the website (Goldberg, 2021). I was not pushed in a certain direction and at no point was I pushed into giving up my information or paying for anything.

 </p>

 <p>
  In conclusion, ‘BusinessTech’ website follows most of the basic design principles and showcases a good User-Interface. Due to this the user-experience is also pleasant. In terms of ethical design, the website does follow a lot of the ethical design practices, however, there are a few areas that could be improved on, such as the transparency of the website.

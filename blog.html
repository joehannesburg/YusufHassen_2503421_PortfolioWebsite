              </header>
              
                <p> Weekly blog posts, hmmm. I’ve never been too good with the whole documenting the process thing(ask my year 1 game design lecturers) but having started journaling recently I figure this would be a good way of documenting the process and getting my thoughts onto paper. Also excited to look back at these early blog posts once we further in to see what a noob I was and how far I’ve come. 
    
                    I have used GitHub last year when looking at CodeMonkey and Brackey’s games (our game design saviors) but it was merely to copy their code and find the game assets….wait, did I say copy, I meant get clues and inspiration of course. I had never uploaded anything to Github prior to this so it was fun and interesting to learn. The tutorial video posted with the instructions was quite clear and easy to follow along so setting up GitHub was simple. As is with all new software, simply watching a video on it isn’t enough to be a pro at it, so once I begin using it often and exploring its features, I’ll definitely get better versed at it. 
                    
                    Whenever I see academic readings, I get PTSD from those damned, spawn of Satan FVPA readings. I believe that readings should be understandable and simple enough for me to enjoy and want to continue with them. Thankfully these readings were. I didn’t need to read them 100 times whilst questioning whether I am just very dumb or whether the reading made no sense at all. “As we may think” by Vannevar Bush (1945) was an extremely interesting reading as I had often thought the idea of revolutionizing and ever-growing tech and science discoveries back in the early 90s was just some wild concept that people thought was crazy. Bush advocated for science and for the improvement of scientific as well as technological advancements. He knew what opportunities lay ahead. It was also interesting to see how far access to information and technology has improved. Things that were seen as the most amazing and fascinating shit of the time are things that are seen as so basic now and this same cycle will continue to go on for as long as technology progresses. “The Library of Babel” by Borges (1944) conveyed a similar meaning to that of Bush but it touched more on the accessibility of information and knowledge. What I understood the beginning of the chapter to be was a comparison between the universe and its vastness and infinite nature to that of a library, as just like the universe is so vast, so too is the information in libraries. Just like the universe seems to be infinite, so too do books and information in libraries. This can also be compared to the internet today. In fact, the internet can more closely be compared to the universe as the internet is basically an endless supply of information. With a few clicks of a button, you have the access to a world or universe full of information. The internet also seems to be something infinite. Your search for something on google and if you scroll down you'll see like 50 other pages of information regarding the thing you searched for. In the olden days, certain pieces of information were limited to certain regions or areas and this made it more difficult to acquire such information. It was not possible for a person from the Southern tip of Africa to get information from the centre of Asia, but like Bush emphasized, with the advancement of technology and the creation of the internet, a person in Africa can have access to the same information as someone from Europe or Asia. 
                    
                    I’m always very confused and I overthink everything, so making decisions are never easy. However, I knew that Interactive Media was going to be my first choice for my major subject. I suck at drawing and game design tormented us abit last year so I wanted to choose something different. Also, frontend developers earn more than illustrators or game designers so that may or may not have also influenced my decision. I’m hoping to learn the necessary skills that will enable me to build and create websites of my own and hopefully get into frontend development with.

              <p> When I was younger, and I thought of coding I would always picture those black screens with a bunch of green text (like we see in the movies). I now realize that coding is just googling basic shit that you forgot how to do and watching YouTube videos on it. Coding can seem overwhelming, especially with my experience with C# from last year. However, with my experience starting with HTML I see that it is very different from C#. It is much simpler to write out code in HTML than it is in C#. C# was so syntax heavy and having to go through the shit ton of Unity documents to see what I needed was hell. HTML seems simple once you know what you are doing, but it does seem tedious. Having to write out <p> a million times can become frustrating, but hey, we get through it. I am excited to get to CSS and Java so that I can learn how to make my website look good and so that my website may have some functionality. 

                The two readings by Lawson, Bruce were interesting. I understand that there are multiple different ways of writing code, but there are certain practices you should follow in order to have ‘Good’ and ‘Digestible’ code. It was also good to hear that people who have a bunch of experience and knowledge in coding and web design still f#*k up sometimes and have ways of improving. 
                
                Prior to this week I never ever thought about finding out the history of the internet. This is strange since I’ve spent hours watching 2 dudes in a village building hot tubs from bamboo on Youtube. When I think of the internet, I always picture it as something that was forever in existence, because we’ve gotten so used to the ability to be able to google anything we want, whenever we want. The thought of not having access to this is scary because like, how the hell did people function? Imagine having to go into a library to find information, ha, couldn’t be me. It was interesting seeing the timeline of the creation of the internet from the very first proposal to all the small and big updates and improvements made over time. All this got me thinking about what life would’ve been like had the internet not existed. Would we be more sociable? Would we have more friends? Would we have gotten through school and Uni, I mean, probably not, barely getting through it even with the internet and all its power and might. However, I’m super glad that we have access to the internet, otherwise how else would I spend all my time if not for scrolling through Instagram and TikTok for hours.

              <p>Learning and working with CSS is extremely fun, but I understand how it can become tedious. However, we’ll leave the fears and anxieties for later. 
                Being an art student, I love designing things and making things look good. Seeing the limitless and endless design options available through CSS is both exciting and also slightly overwhelming. Like, I can do so many different things, where do I start? I also like that writing code in CSS is simple just like with HTML. If I want to change the margins I simply type in margin, or if I want to change the font colour I type that in and I am able to change it. I know that it’ll take a lot of practice to get used to all the selectors and options available in CSS but I’m excited to get into it. 
                
                I love how the reading, lecture, as well as the video, were all related in some way. I particularly enjoyed the video about bad doors (It’s not you. Bad doors are everywhere 2016) as it explored the importance of design decisions and the general interface and interaction with things. Don Norman speaks about how discoverability and feedback are important in the design of things. This really struck a cord with me and it’s something that I will continue to think about whenever I make something. Don says, “why do you have to have a sign that says push or pull? Why not make it obvious?”. This point ties into one from the reading, “traditional conventions are repetitions that become regularities against which differences stand out” (Mailloux 2015: 400). When practices are repeated it becomes a convention that is understood by the majority of people. For example, the colour red has always been made to signify danger. Through the repeated use of this colour to represent danger, it is now a convention for representing danger, and just like Don said, there is now no need to point out what it means, it is obvious. This can also tie in with web design since there are already certain conventions and repeated practices which make it easier for people to understand. If I place a button or link on my website, having it highlighted when hovered over or when clicked on is a repeated practice and a convention for good usability and a good interface. It makes the action obvious and it gives the user feedback. Since web design is all about the user interface and experience, it is important to know how to design an interface that will give off a good experience. 
                
                Watching the past lecture gave me abit of a flashback to our first year of uni and having all our lectures online, just seeing our lecturers faces on a small floating bubble. I do feel slightly overwhelmed when consuming multiple sources of information as I get accustomed to a particular person and particular teaching method, so I sometimes find it difficult to adjust to another as well. However, the past lecture was helpful as it dove into additional information, such as the use of ‘before’ and ‘after’ selectors. There are so many things to learn within all these coding languages, and the more you interact with it and the more content you absorb the more well versed you will become with it.

                </header>
                <p>  This week was slightly overwhelming, as we already moved on to JavaScript, whilst I’m still trying to learn HTML and CSS. Three different languages over 3 weeks scares me, however, it was super exciting to learn about the basics of Javascript. Seeing where websites gets its functionality from and the insane things you can do with it is quite cool.

                    I really enjoyed this weeks readings, especially the Basic Principles of User Interface Design one, (Studio by UXPin, 2020). From the 14 principles they mentioned, I began to take note of how many of those principles have I implemented and how many have I not even thought of. For example, I was planning on making a minimalistic and simple website, which ties in with the 4th principle on aiming for simplicity. When looking at the wireframes I’ve made, I immediately noticed what needed to be changed. For my blog page wireframe, I did not think about making the blogs easily accessible, I just assumed that the viewers would scroll down, but now I realize that I should add in hyperlinks to take the viewers to each blog post. 
                    
                    We described interactivity as something that is responsive, requires effort, and does not respond in a random way. Therefore, UI directly relates to interactivity. UI is what allows users to respond to something and receive feedback, and it requires users to put in effort to use it. UI is essentially the skeleton for interactivity on websites and therefore it shows just how important good UI and UX design is.

                  <h3>Week 5 & 6 Blog</h3>
                </header>
                <p>I spent these 2 weeks playing catch up on all the content I missed out on. I put everything I needed to do on a to do list and oh damn did it get long. Whilst going through some of the previous weeks work, a lot more things started clicking and making sense. Now when I look at a website I can more or less tell what code was used for a specific element and isn’t that just so damn cool. I’m still kind of stuck on the coding aspect of this and trying to learn and practice at the same time. I guess once I actually start building my website and joining all these individual elements together will I truly learn the languages and all that it entails. I’ve also began going through random websites to gain some inspiration for the website I’m going to build. There are so many cool and well designed websites out there and theres so much to learn from. I’m nervous, a tiny bit scared but also excited to see what I can turn my website into.</p>

                  <h3>Week 7 Blog</h3>
                </header>
                <p>I have completed my home page, profile page as well as essay page so far. I thought I’d finish the shortest ones first before going onto the longer ones (probably not the best idea, I know).

                    In terms of the IxD process, the first step is the goal alignment. The goal of my website is to represent who I am and to inform viewers on who I am and what it is that I do. For now the target audience is just peers, tutors and lecturers, but for the future the target audience would be companies that are looking to potentially hire me.
                    In order for me to reach this goal I need to think about how I’d like the website to represent me and what exactly it is that I’d like to showcase. 
                    I have already done my content mapping with my wireframes and I have an overall idea of what I want to put where. 
                    I haven’t yet done a user flow diagram and it’s definitely something that I should do so that I can see whether my UI design is efficient or not. 
                    In terms of interface elements, the only thing I have and I felt that I needed for my website so far is buttons and text with hyperlinks. For informational components, I have put in related icons and images that convey what each page is about. 
                    One thing that I am struggling with is the hierarchy. I have a lot of empty spaces which I think is fine, but I also do want to fill it, but I also don’t want to add in anything unnecessary. 
                    I’m using very basic and simple fonts and colours, to keep my website simple and to make sure everything is legible. I’m a bit of an OCD freak sometimes so alignment and symmetry is very important to me. 
                    
                    The IxD process is quite long, but definitely important to go through. I’ve already started going through each step of the process and looking at what I’ve already done to see if it fits in with the process and if it’s correct.

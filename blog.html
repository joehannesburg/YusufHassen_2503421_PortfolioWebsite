                    Weekly blog posts, hmmm. I’ve never been too good with the whole documenting the process thing(ask my year 1 game design lecturers) but having started journaling recently I figure this would be a good way of documenting the process and getting my thoughts onto paper. Also excited to look back at these early blog posts once we further in to see what a noob I was and how far I’ve come. </p>

<p>I have used GitHub last year when looking at CodeMonkey and Brackey’s games (our game design saviors) but it was merely to copy their code and find the game assets….wait, did I say copy, I meant get clues and inspiration of course. I had never uploaded anything to Github prior to this so it was fun and interesting to learn. The tutorial video posted with the instructions was quite clear and easy to follow along so setting up GitHub was simple. As is with all new software, simply watching a video on it isn’t enough to be a pro at it, so once I begin using it often and exploring its features, I’ll definitely get better versed at it.</p>

Whenever I see academic readings, I get PTSD from those damned, spawn of Satan FVPA readings. I believe that readings should be understandable and simple enough for me to enjoy and want to continue with them. Thankfully these readings were. I didn’t need to read them 100 times whilst questioning whether I am just very dumb or whether the reading made no sense at all. “As we may think” by Vannevar Bush (1945) was an extremely interesting reading as I had often thought the idea of revolutionizing and ever-growing tech and science discoveries back in the early 90s was just some wild concept that people thought was crazy. Bush advocated for science and for the improvement of scientific as well as technological advancements. He knew what opportunities lay ahead. It was also interesting to see how far access to information and technology has improved. Things that were seen as the most amazing and fascinating shit of the time are things that are seen as so basic now and this same cycle will continue to go on for as long as technology progresses. “The Library of Babel” by Borges (1944) conveyed a similar meaning to that of Bush but it touched more on the accessibility of information and knowledge. What I understood the beginning of the chapter to be was a comparison between the universe and its vastness and infinite nature to that of a library, as just like the universe is so vast, so too is the information in libraries. Just like the universe seems to be infinite, so too do books and information in libraries. This can also be compared to the internet today. In fact, the internet can more closely be compared to the universe as the internet is basically an endless supply of information. With a few clicks of a button, you have the access to a world or universe full of information. The internet also seems to be something infinite. Your search for something on google and if you scroll down you'll see like 50 other pages of information regarding the thing you searched for. In the olden days, certain pieces of information were limited to certain regions or areas and this made it more difficult to acquire such information. It was not possible for a person from the Southern tip of Africa to get information from the centre of Asia, but like Bush emphasized, with the advancement of technology and the creation of the internet, a person in Africa can have access to the same information as someone from Europe or Asia. 

<p>I’m always very confused and I overthink everything, so making decisions are never easy. However, I knew that Interactive Media was going to be my first choice for my major subject. I suck at drawing and game design tormented us abit last year so I wanted to choose something different. Also, frontend developers earn more than illustrators or game designers so that may or may not have also influenced my decision. I’m hoping to learn the necessary skills that will enable me to build and create websites of my own and hopefully get into frontend development with.

                     <p> When I was younger, and I thought of coding I would always picture those black screens with a bunch of green text (like we see in the movies). I now realize that coding is just googling basic shit that you forgot how to do and watching YouTube videos on it. Coding can seem overwhelming, especially with my experience with C# from last year. However, with my experience starting with HTML I see that it is very different from C#. It is much simpler to write out code in HTML than it is in C#. C# was so syntax heavy and having to go through the shit ton of Unity documents to see what I needed was hell. HTML seems simple once you know what you are doing, but it does seem tedious. Having to write out p a million times can become frustrating, but hey, we get through it. I am excited to get to CSS and Java so that I can learn how to make my website look good and so that my website may have some functionality. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The two readings by Lawson, Bruce were interesting. I understand that there are multiple different ways of writing code, but there are certain practices you should follow in order to have ‘Good’ and ‘Digestible’ code. It was also good to hear that people who have a bunch of experience and knowledge in coding and web design still f#*k up sometimes and have ways of improving. </p>
                <p>Prior to this week I never ever thought about finding out the history of the internet. This is strange since I’ve spent hours watching 2 dudes in a village building hot tubs from bamboo on Youtube. When I think of the internet, I always picture it as something that was forever in existence, because we’ve gotten so used to the ability to be able to google anything we want, whenever we want. The thought of not having access to this is scary because like, how the hell did people function? Imagine having to go into a library to find information, ha, couldn’t be me. It was interesting seeing the timeline of the creation of the internet from the very first proposal to all the small and big updates and improvements made over time. All this got me thinking about what life would’ve been like had the internet not existed. Would we be more sociable? Would we have more friends? Would we have gotten through school and Uni, I mean, probably not, barely getting through it even with the internet and all its power and might. However, I’m super glad that we have access to the internet, otherwise how else would I spend all my time if not for scrolling through Instagram and TikTok for hours. </p> </article>

                      Learning and working with CSS is extremely fun, but I understand how it can become tedious. However, we’ll leave the fears and anxieties for later. 
  Being an art student, I love designing things and making things look good. Seeing the limitless and endless design options available through CSS is both exciting and also slightly overwhelming. Like, I can do so many different things, where do I start? I also like that writing code in CSS is simple just like with HTML. If I want to change the margins I simply type in margin, or if I want to change the font colour I type that in and I am able to change it. I know that it’ll take a lot of practice to get used to all the selectors and options available in CSS but I’m excited to get into it. 
  
                    </p>
                    <p>I love how the reading, lecture, as well as the video, were all related in some way. I particularly enjoyed the video about bad doors (It’s not you. Bad doors are everywhere 2016) as it explored the importance of design decisions and the general interface and interaction with things. Don Norman speaks about how discoverability and feedback are important in the design of things. This really struck a cord with me and it’s something that I will continue to think about whenever I make something. Don says, “why do you have to have a sign that says push or pull? Why not make it obvious?”. This point ties into one from the reading, “traditional conventions are repetitions that become regularities against which differences stand out” (Mailloux 2015: 400). When practices are repeated it becomes a convention that is understood by the majority of people. For example, the colour red has always been made to signify danger. Through the repeated use of this colour to represent danger, it is now a convention for representing danger, and just like Don said, there is now no need to point out what it means, it is obvious. This can also tie in with web design since there are already certain conventions and repeated practices which make it easier for people to understand. If I place a button or link on my website, having it highlighted when hovered over or when clicked on is a repeated practice and a convention for good usability and a good interface. It makes the action obvious and it gives the user feedback. Since web design is all about the user interface and experience, it is important to know how to design an interface that will give off a good experience. </p>
                 <p>Watching the past lecture gave me abit of a flashback to our first year of uni and having all our lectures online, just seeing our lecturers faces on a small floating bubble. I do feel slightly overwhelmed when consuming multiple sources of information as I get accustomed to a particular person and particular teaching method, so I sometimes find it difficult to adjust to another as well. However, the past lecture was helpful as it dove into additional information, such as the use of ‘before’ and ‘after’ selectors. There are so many things to learn within all these coding languages, and the more you interact with it and the more content you absorb the more well versed you will become with it. </p>

                      This week was slightly overwhelming, as we already moved on to JavaScript, whilst I’m still trying to learn HTML and CSS. Three different languages over 3 weeks scares me, however, it was super exciting to learn about the basics of Javascript. Seeing where websites gets its functionality from and the insane things you can do with it is quite cool.
                    </p>
<p>I really enjoyed this weeks readings, especially the Basic Principles of User Interface Design one, (Studio by UXPin, 2020). From the 14 principles they mentioned, I began to take note of how many of those principles have I implemented and how many have I not even thought of. For example, I was planning on making a minimalistic and simple website, which ties in with the 4th principle on aiming for simplicity. When looking at the wireframes I’ve made, I immediately noticed what needed to be changed. For my blog page wireframe, I did not think about making the blogs easily accessible, I just assumed that the viewers would scroll down, but now I realize that I should add in hyperlinks to take the viewers to each blog post. </p>
                <p>We described interactivity as something that is responsive, requires effort, and does not respond in a random way. Therefore, UI directly relates to interactivity. UI is what allows users to respond to something and receive feedback, and it requires users to put in effort to use it. UI is essentially the skeleton for interactivity on websites and therefore it shows just how important good UI and UX design is.</p>

                      I spent this week playing catch up on all the content I missed out on. I put everything I needed to do on a to do list and oh damn did it get long. Whilst going through some of the previous weeks work, a lot more things started clicking and making sense. Now when I look at a website I can more or less tell what code was used for a specific element and isn’t that just so damn cool. I’m still kind of stuck on the coding aspect of this and trying to learn and practice at the same time. I guess once I actually start building my website and joining all these individual elements together will I truly learn the languages and all that it entails. I’ve also began going through random websites to gain some inspiration for the website I’m going to build. There are so many cool and well designed websites out there and theres so much to learn from. I’m nervous, a tiny bit scared but also excited to see what I can turn my website into.

                      I have completed my home page, profile page as well as essay page so far. I thought I’d finish the shortest ones first before going onto the longer ones (probably not the best idea, I know).
                    </p>
                    <p>In terms of the IxD process, the first step is the goal alignment. The goal of my website is to represent who I am and to inform viewers on who I am and what it is that I do. For now the target audience is just peers, tutors and lecturers, but for the future the target audience would be companies that are looking to potentially hire me.
                      In order for me to reach this goal I need to think about how I’d like the website to represent me and what exactly it is that I’d like to showcase. 
                      I have already done my content mapping with my wireframes and I have an overall idea of what I want to put where. 
                      I haven’t yet done a user flow diagram and it’s definitely something that I should do so that I can see whether my UI design is efficient or not. 
                      In terms of interface elements, the only thing I have and I felt that I needed for my website so far is buttons and text with hyperlinks. For informational components, I have put in related icons and images that convey what each page is about. 
                      One thing that I am struggling with is the hierarchy. I have a lot of empty spaces which I think is fine, but I also do want to fill it, but I also don’t want to add in anything unnecessary. 
                      I’m using very basic and simple fonts and colours, to keep my website simple and to make sure everything is legible. I’m a bit of an OCD freak sometimes so alignment and symmetry is very important to me. 
                      </p>
                      <p>The IxD process is quite long, but definitely important to go through. I’ve already started going through each step of the process and looking at what I’ve already done to see if it fits in with the process and if it’s correct.

                      Reflection on website: Making the website was definitely an interesting experience. Actually making a website and coding was the best way of getting experience. When I began with it I was very lost and confused but as I went through it and did more of it, a lot of the coding became easier and natural. Unfortunately due to me being away and due to it being the month of Ramadhan I did really struggle to find the time to work on the website. What I struggled on was with uploading my files to GitHub. For some reason my images weren’t loading and all my files weren’t uploading to GitHub. It was very frustrating but I eventually managed to sort it out. I do think that I had a fairly decent and functioning website. I was happy that I could my semantic practices were in order and my code was structured properly. I wasn’t able to do any media queries therefore if my website was to be viewed on a screen different to mines it might look abit odd. As fun as using CSS was to make my website look good, it did become abit tedious after a while. For my next project I know to start as early as possible so I can spend as much time as possible on it and add it whatever I wish to add. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Reflection on readings: The first article, "Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results" by Ballatore, Graham, and Sen (2017), focuses specifically on search engine results and how they can vary depending on location. It discusses how these variations can create biases and power dynamics in information access.
                      The second article, "Towards a Study of Information Geographies: (Im)Mutable Augmentations and a Mapping of the Geographies of Information" by Graham, De Sabbata, and Zook (2015), takes a broader approach by exploring the concept of information geographies. It examines how information is distributed unevenly across the globe and how factors like power, politics, and infrastructure shape these geographies.
                      Both articles highlight the importance of understanding the complex relationship between digital technologies, geography, and the access and distribution of information. They raise awareness about the potential biases and inequalities that can arise in the digital realm, emphasizing the need for further research and analysis to address these issues.
                      </p>
                    <p>After going through all of these readings you begin to see that websites and the internet as a whole are not just made up of code, but there's so much more to it. Businesses and corporations often have ulterior motives and agendas. As South African web developers it is our duty to ensure that the work we do and the websites we make are a means of goodness for the people that access it and we should try to increase the representation of South African work. Web design is not only based on making a functioning website that looks good, but there are many responsibilities tied to it as well.</p>

Development of my website: The first thing I am adding into my website is responsive design as it’s something I had left out previously. I was also thrilled to learn about the different types of measurements in CSS. I didn’t use any relative measurements previously and mainly only used pixels. I will be changing those measurements to relative measurements which will assist with the responsive design as well.

                    </p>
                    <p>Close Reading: The reading I chose is the one on the fourth industrial revolution in South Africa (Sutherland, 2019). It speaks about the significant change happening in the world with the fourth industrial evolution and how it’s affecting South Africa in particular. Something that always blows my mind is the unemployment rate in South Africa. It is shockingly high, and Sutherland speaks about this in his article. He talks about how this fourth industrial revolution can both exacerbate and offer opportunities to the challenges we face in South Africa (Sutherland, 2019). One point that I highly agree with and I hope to be a part of one day is the fact that investing in education and skills development so that we as South Africans are well equipped to participate in the digital economy is extremely important. A lack of resources and a lack of excitement for knowledge is something which greatly deprives our country. 
                      I’ve visited Dubai many times and the one thing that always stands out to me is the innovation and desire for greatness that the people have. The government focuses a lot of their time and energy and efforts into uplifting and empowering its people. Through this effort the country has achieved so much over the last few years. What was just a desert 50 years ago is now one of the most visited cities in the world. 
                      Technology is all around us and it’s become something that we simply cannot live without. The rate at which technology is progressing is both amazing and scary and if we don’t empower ourselves and get with the ever changing times we will fall behind from the rest of the world.

                      Development of my website: As fun and as interesting it is to learn new coding languages it can also feel very overwhelming. This is what it has been like for Javascript. I understand the capabilities of it and I understand how I’d like to use it in my website. I plan to use JavaScript to add animations and effects to my website. For example, I’d like to have a carousel on my home page which will link to the other pages of my website. I’d also like to use it for my blog post section to make it more streamlined and easily accessible.

                    <p>Close Reading: The reading I chose is the Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory as Sociotechnical Foresight in Artificial Intelligence reading (Mohamed, Png and Isaac, 2020). The reason I chose this reading is due to my keen interest in AI. I find it so fascinating that AI can do the things that it does. This year alone, so many new AI tools have been released and the capabilities of these tools are mind blowing. 
                      This reading explores how decolonial theory and AI interlink. As a web designer this reading also reminded of how I should consider the social and cultural implications of technology in my design practices. "While AI systems are often touted as neutral and objective, they are embedded with the biases and assumptions of their creators and the data they are trained on. By centering decolonial theory in AI development, we can challenge these biases and work towards more culturally sensitive and inclusive technologies." (Mohamed, Png and Isaac, 2020). This made me reflect on the potential biases that may exist within AI systems and how they can spread inequality if not addressed. Incorporating decolonial theory into web design can help me critically analyze the underlying assumptions, data sources, and algorithms that shape the websites and applications I create. It has also motivated me to seek out alternative viewpoints, challenge existing norms, and continually learn about the impacts of my design choices.

Development of my website: With my first submission for my website I was able to link my HTML and CSS efficiently. I did not do any styling within HTML, but rather, all my styling was done in CSS. I had also used naming conventions which was easily understandable and which would allow me to go back at any time and make whatever changes are necessary. I will be adding JS to my website for the next submission and I learnt how JS can remove some of the repetitive code from my HTML and CSS. I’ve not yet coded in JS so it will take me some time to familiarize myself with it. 
In terms of responsive design I understand how important it is. With my previous website it was not responsive, so if it was viewed on devices with different sizes to the one I made the website on the contents would not be shown in the way I’d like it to. The benefits of responsive design is mainly accessibility and viewability. It allows your website to serve its function and showcase what it’s meant to showcase in a readable way no matter what device it's viewed on. After learning about relative measurements with CSS a few weeks back I will be using that instead of what I used in my previous website. Instead of using pixels for every measurement I will instead use ‘vh’ and ‘em’. 

                    </p>

                    <p>How Code Matters: Before starting out with web design I always viewed code as simply being instructions to a machine. I didn’t think of it as any more. After learning all that we did, in particular, the How We Code Matters lecture, I now understand that coding is a language, and just like with languages, what you write matters and has great meaning. As you get older you realize how the words we use matter. A simple thing like greeting someone or giving instructions to someone can be said in many different ways, but some ways are better than others. Likewise with code, there’s multiple ways of doing something, but there’s some ways which are better than others. For my first submission I followed the rubric and requirements and didn’t think much about my code and how it matters. For example, I didn’t think to use colours which can be viewed even by people with visual impairments. I didn’t think to add a dark mode as well. 
                      I now know to question my choices and designs. I’ve also begun to notice how other websites do things well or not. I now look at websites from a more picky and investigative eye and this allows me to shape my designs in a way that will reflect good, ethical design.

                      Development of my website: I was really intrigued by the API lecture this week. It’s amazing to see the capabilities of JavaScript and how much of functionality it adds to a website. I’d really like to add a fun or humorous aspect to my website and I can do this using API’s. I was thinking of adding in a random meme generator to my website using an API. I understand that I will face technical challenges with this. API’s aren’t the easiest to understand and use. I will first need to learn more about API’s and how I can implement them into my website.
                    </p>
                    <p>Reflection of reading: The reading has brought to my attention the significant challenges faced by transgender individuals while traveling, and it has made me realize the importance of inclusive design in addressing these issues. I never thought that something like an airport scanner could cause issues for minorities. There are so many things which we use often which haven’t been designed in the most inclusive way. Now that we learning about inclusive design I start to notice these things more often. Another example that comes to mind is toilets. Muslims need to use water to cleanse themselves in the toilet and unfortunately in majority of toilets there is no water in the stalls. There are over 2 billion Muslims in the world. That is almost a quarter of the entire worlds population. So one would think that something as small as having water in a toilet would have been implemented by now. 
                      As a web designer, it is crucial for me to be aware of these challenges and to actively work towards creating more inclusive and equitable digital experiences for all users.
                      The writer speaks about design justice, which involves having people from marginalized communities join into the design process (Costanza-Chock 2020). I wholeheartedly agree with this. In 90% of movies or series where a Muslim character is showcased, they are almost never represented as what Muslims truly are. If they had involved Muslims in the design process then there wouldn’t be an issue of misinterpretation. 
                      Overall, this reading has been a valuable lesson in the intersection of design, social justice, and the experiences of marginalized communities.

                      Development of my website: After researching API’s I seen the wide range of uses for it. As mentioned last week I’d really like to add in a fun aspect to my website. I can do this using API’s. For example, I can add in a random meme generator or a random joke generator. When I have worked on more than one project and when I will use my portfolio website to apply for jobs I’ll add in GitHub API’s which will link my other GitHub projects to my website. I can also add in an API which will integrate clients or colleagues testimonials.

                      “What is digital equality? An interview with Nanjira Sambuli”
                      
                      I strongly connect with the idea of digital equality, especially in my own country. South Africa, like many other places, struggles to close the gap in access to technology. It's sad to see that disadvantaged communities still don't have the basic digital tools and affordable internet. This divide not only makes existing social inequalities worse, but it also holds back our ability to grow economically and empower everyone. Sambuli advocates for comprehensive digital education programs that equip individuals with the necessary skills and knowledge to navigate the digital world effectively (Sambuli, 2019). 
                      The interview highlights the importance of teaching people how to use digital technology properly through education programs. This idea strikes a chord with me as a student studying web design as I recognize the role I can play in promoting digital literacy and empowering others to harness the potential of technology.

                      <p>“Daniolou - 2020 - The Need for Global Internet Connectivity”

                        The global digital divide outlined in the article highlights the harsh reality that many regions, especially in developing countries like ours, still lack adequate internet access. This divide hinders progress and limits opportunities for individuals. I think of the school system in our country and how over the last 10 to 20 years not a lot has changed. Whilst some schools do make some use of technology, a lot don’t. The school I attended is yet to introduce the white smart boards and projectors. I feel like technology within the schooling system should be mandatory. Daniolou also points out that countries with inadequate access struggle to attract investments, develop digital economies, and compete in the global digital marketplace (Daniolou, 2020). As a student I know that having access to the internet is really important for finding educational resources and coming up with new ideas. Without the internet I would not be able to do most of what I need for university. When there's limited internet connection, it makes it hard for students to use online tools for learning and stops them from creating new solutions to problems in their community.

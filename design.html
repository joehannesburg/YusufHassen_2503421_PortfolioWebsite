        <article class="IxD-content">
          <p> <span>Goal Alignment</span> - The goal for this website was to create a portfolio website which firstly showcases my skills as a web developer, and secondly, showcases who I am. I want users to be able to see who I am and the capabilities I have through the website. The ideal target audience for this website would be companies and recruiters.</p>
            <p> <span>Information Structure</span></p>
            <p class="indent-txt"> a)Home - The home page should give a brief overview of who I am and what the website entails. It should have links to all the other pages.</p>
           <p class="indent-txt"> b)Profile - The profile page should give more information about me. Things such as my interests, skills, education and experience should be shown here.</p> 
           <p class="indent-txt"> c)Blogs - The blog page will have all the weeks blogs. Ideally it should be systemized and orderly.</p>
           <p class="indent-txt"> d)Essay - The essay page will have the essay that I will have written.  </p>
           <p class="indent-txt"> e)Design - The design page will be the longest and hardest to do. It will need to represent the design process of the website. It should also be orderly and systemized.</p>
           <p class="indent-txt">f)Portfolio - The portfolio page will showcase a few pieces of work that I have done. It should include images of the work and a short description of what it is. </p>
           <p><span>User Flow</span> </p>
           <img src="./Images/Untitled_Artwork (1).jpg" alt="User Flow image">
             
             
             
              <p><span>Interface Elements</span> - In terms of interface elements, the main things I will be using are links for the navigation as well as dropdown buttons for the blog posts. At this stage of my website I don’t think I’ll need other elements. .</p>
                <p><span>Style Process</span> </p>
                <p class="indent-txt">Visual Aesthetic - The visual aesthetic I was aiming for was a minimalistic one. I didn’t want too many colours or things that pop at you, rather, it should be something that’s cool and calming. </p>
                <p class="indent-txt">Visual Design Elements:</p>
                <p class="indent-txt">a)Fonts - The fonts I used are simple, yet common fonts. I used Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma and Sans Serif.</p>
                <p class="indent-txt">b)Readability - Due to using simple fonts, all my text is readable. I have made the font sizes readable as well. </p>
                <p class="indent-txt">c)Colours - The initial colour scheme for my website was orange and blue, but after some consideration I realized that this wasn’t ideal for what I wanted my website to be. I therefore changed it to blues and greys. This fits in with the minimalistic and cooling aesthetic that I was going for. The text colours are either black or white, which blends in with the colour pattern but that also stands out against it for readability. </p>
               <p class="indent-txt">d)Colour Theory - The colour palettes I have used are a range of blues and greys. 7DB0CF, 9BAFC5, 8AADC5, B6CCDE, CED6E0. All these colours blend in well together.</p>

        <p><span>Goal & Aesthetic</span> - My goal is to have a website that represents me and that showcases my passions, talents, and character, and I think that the aesthetic of the vibrant, simple, and calming nature of the website represents me well.</p>
        <p><span>Visual Design Elements</span> - The visual design elements I made use of is a simple background with the colour palette mentioned above. In order to highlight the text more I added in a background for the text which is a gradient of two types of blues. My text is either black or white and with a simple font. There is nothing too fancy or extraordinary, but rather, simple and sufficient.</p>

        <article class="implement-content">
        <p><span>Folder Structure:</span>- My folder structure reflects the hierarchical information structure of my
          content. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All my data and the skeleton structure are in HTML, and the presentation layer or 'clothing' is in CSS. I have a few functions in JavaScript. The naming conventions I used are in a simple to understand yet orderly manner, which will allow me to go back at any time and make any necessary changes. Despite having just one CSS script for all 6 pages of HTML content, using classes and IDs, I was able to keep all my code in order.
         </p>
         <p><span>Semantic Markup:</span>- Before beginning with this assignment, the semantic markup portion scared me as I wasn't sure if I'd get the hang of it so early on. I was hoping not to have to be one of those that have a million divs in my code, but thankfully, once I started coding, I quickly got the hang of it and was able to semantically code. In my first assignment I used a few divs, but this time around I was able to not use any divs and instead made efficient use of headers, footers, mains, nav, and other relevant tags. I also used a lot of article and section tags which I didn’t make use of previously. All my interface elements are displayed as I wished for it to be without any errors or issues. I understand that for a website to be run efficiently and for it to be search engine optimized, semantics are very important. I have also added in more meta tags which will give the browser more information about my website. </p>
         <p><span>JavaScript:</span>- Having used HTML and CSS since the beginning and using it for the first website, I was well versed with it and understood how to write out what I needed to. However, it was my first time using JavaScript so it was abit of a challenge for me. I used it to write out functions for my navbar as well as for my blog posts section. I made sure to not exceed 8 lines of code for a single function and I was able to link it to my HTML and CSS.  </p>
         <p><span>CSS:</span>- I did not use any in-text styling in HTML. All my styling is only done in CSS.
          With the use of classes and IDs and proper naming conventions, my code is scalable and modular, and if at any time any changes need to be made, it will be very easy to make those changes. I changed all the old measurement units I had as these weren’t relative and didn’t assist with responsive design. I used relative units such as em, vh and vw so that no matter what device the website is viewed on, it will be responsive.

        <article class="improve-content">
        <p><span>Assignment 3:</span>  </p>
        <p class="indent-txt">a) Style - The first thing I wanted to change was the aesthetic and colours of the website. Whilst I did like the previous orange and blue colours, I found it to be slightly distracting from the more important text. I also wanted to try and maintain the clean and minimalistic look. For that reason I chose this blueish grey background which is showcased on every page and which allows me to have the important text stand out. </p>
        <p class="indent-txt">b) HTML - After receiving feedback from the previous edition of the website, I made a few changes to my code. With HTML I got rid of all divs and I added in more semantic markup. </p>
        <p class="indent-txt">c) CSS - In my previous website, I didn't make use of relative measurement and responsive design. Using CSS, I now changed all my measurements to relative measurements and my website is mostly responsive, with the exception of a few things like the navbar and index page.</p>
        <p class="indent-txt">d) JavaScript - This was my first time using JavaScript so I wasn't too well versed with it. I added in two functions with JavaScript. The first function is for the blogs. It allowed me to create an accordion style blog page in which you can simply click on a blog to expand or close it. The second function I added in was for the navbar. When you begin scrolling on the website the navbar will remain at the top and it will slightly change its background colour so that it is more visible when shown over other content. </p>

         <p><span>Exam:</span> </p>
          <p class="indent-txt">a) Style - I kept the same style and aesthetic from the previous assignment as I was pleased with the way it came out. The only main styling change I made this time was for the essay page.  </p>
          <p class="indent-txt">b) HTML - I was extremely pleased to see that I did well with my semantic markup and coding structures for the previous assignment. For this exam, I have added in a few micro-formats throughout my code as I did not have this previously.</p>
          <p class="indent-txt">c) CSS - The one thing I was not able to do in the previous assignment was have a responsive navbar, as well as having media queries for responsive design. I have added in media queries and my navbar is now fully responsive which will allow the website to be viewed on multiple devices and screen sizes. </p>
          <p class="indent-txt">d) JavaScript - I lost most of my marks in the previous section because of not having enough JavaScript. I knew I needed to add this in to my final exam website. I have 4 JavaScript functions which allow for JS driven navigation, a sticky navbar which changes colour when you scroll, an accordion style blog post page which creates a neat and organized layout of all the blogs, and finally, a tabbed style essay page which allows you to switch between the two essays with a click of a button. I also made sure I followed the rubric requirements for JavaScript.I have concise functions,consistent variable declerations, consistent semicolons, consistent case usage and consistent JS driven navigation. There is also 4 parts of the website which require JavaScript to function. The navbar, navigation to other pages, the essay page and the blog page all require JavaScript to function.  </p>

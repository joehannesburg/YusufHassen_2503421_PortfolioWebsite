     <h3>IxD Process:</h3>

    <p>
   <span>Goal Alignment</span>  - The goal of this website was to represent who I am and to showcase it to whosoever sees this website.
    <br> 
  <span>Information Structure</span>   - As can be seen in my initial wireframes, I had an idea of where my content was going to go. These ideas did change as I progressed through building my website. For example, on the blog page I initially had the layout different to what it is now. I tried placing my content in a position which would attract the viewer and be easily viewable.
    <br>
   <span>Interface Elements</span>  - On all pages of my website I have a nav section at the top of the page with hyperlinks that will take you to different pages. I hesitated between choosing a button design or just having the text, but in keeping with somewhat of a minimalistic look I decided to stick with just the text. On my home page I have two icons which are also hyperlinks to my social media profiles. Aparrt from the hyperlinks that aren't any other elements like these on my website. Of course, I do have a lot of text and backgrounds on my website. This is what makes up most of the website.

<p> <span>Visual Design</span> - As we've previously learned, simple is quite often the best. This is what I aimed at in terms of fonts and colours for this website. I used the simple, but readable fonts. In terms of colours I was going for something that stands out but that's also cooling and calming. I love blue so I had to find something that had a shade of blue in it. For most of the text, it's either in black or white. This is because white and black stand out against the blue and peach background and it goes well with it.  </p>

<section class="style-guide">
    <h4>Style Guide:</h4>

    <p> <span>Goals & Aesthetics</span> - My goal is to have a website that represents me and that showcases my passions, talents and character and I think that the aesthetic of the vibrant, simple and calming nature of the website does represent  me.  
    <br>
    <span>Visual Design Elements</span> - I went with a simple aesthetic and visuall design. The background images of each page are the same two colours but vary in design. I enjoy the contrast and the slight change between each page. I've chosen the basic fonts as well to ensure eligibilty and simplicity. All other backrounds are either white or a light grey in colour to not take away from the bright background.

    <h6>Implimentation Notes:</h6>
    
    <p> A. My folder structure does reflect the hierarchical information structure of my content. I used html and css, not Javascript. All my data and the skeleton structure is in html and the presentation layer or 'clothing' is in css. The naming conventions I used are in a simple to understand yet orderly manner which will allow me to go back at anytime and make any changes necessary. Despite having just one css script for all 6 pages of html content, using classes and Id's, I was able to keep all my code in order.
<br> <br>

        B. Before beginning with this assignment this semantic markup portion scared me as I wasn't sure if I'd get the hang of it so early on. I was hoping not to have be one of those that have a million divs in my code, but thankfully, once I started coding I quickly got the hang of it and was able to semantically code. I barely used divs and made efficient use of headers, footers, mains, nav and other relevant tags. All my interface elements are displayed as I wished for it to be without any errors or issues. I understand that in order for a website to be ran efficiently and in order for it to be search engine optimized, semantics is very important. Therefore I am happy to be getting into the practice of semantic coding from the beginning.
        <br> <br>
        D. I did not use any in text styling in html. All my styling is only done in css. With the use of classes and id's and proper naming conventions, my code is scalable and modular and if at any time any changes need to be made, it will be very easy to make those changes. I unfortunately did not use responsive layouts so my layout will only be suitable for one particular screen size. However this is something I will change in the future.</p>
